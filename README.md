This experimental project adds a page to the client zone in UISP. Clients are able to opt into or out of an ad blocking service.

Using these responses and UISP API calls, this plugin creates NAT rules to redirect certain DNS requests to a specific server, thereby providing ad blocking to all devices in a client site.
